## Architecture & Tech

- SwiftUI with MVVM-style state management
- `@Observable` and `@Bindable` (iOS 17+)
- Networking abstracted via `NetworkClient` protocol
- Animated logo and error handling
- Static previews for all views

---

## Auth Token Handling

- Token saved securely to `UserDefaults` upon login
- Automatically injected into API requests
- Future logout support can clear tokens

---

## Nice-to-Haves Implemented

- Animations (logo bounce, shake error, green check)
- Custom SF Symbol styling
- Scroll performance optimizations
- Modular and reusable components (`ChatBubble`, `ProfileRow`)
- Unit test-ready architecture (mockable network layer)
- Designed with light/dark mode support

---

## Implementation Notes

-	All networking is abstracted to allow easy mocking or swapping clients
-	Used @Observable and @Bindable to align with latest SwiftUI standards
-	The login token is securely stored in UserDefaults for session persistence
-	Static tabs (Chat, Journal, Profile) were designed to feel like functional features
-	On login success, a green check icon overlays to confirm success before transitioning
-	Error messaging is animated and accessible
-	Tabs use SF Symbols where possible, with fallback images for design consistency
